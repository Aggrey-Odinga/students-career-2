                    <p>
                        The Students Career Guide provides students with expert guidance,
                        tools, and assistance in developing and implementing their career
                        plans. Many students lack the fundamental knowledge required to
                        choose a career after completing their secondary education before
                        enrolling in university or college. One major issue is that many
                        of them are unfamiliar with the courses offered by higher
                        education institutions. Another issue is that many students are
                        unaware that simply meeting the cut-off points for admission to a
                        university or college does not imply that they are qualified to
                        pursue all of the courses offered by all universities or colleges.
                        There is a limit based on your average score and the subjects you
                        took for the KCSE exam. I believe that secondary students should
                        be informed and trained on how to "go about it" when selecting a
                        career path as early as possible.....
