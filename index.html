            <p>
              The Students Career Guide provides students with expert guidance,
              tools, and assistance in developing and implementing their career
              plans. Many students lack the fundamental knowledge required to
              choose a career after completing their secondary education before
              enrolling in university or college. One major issue is that many
              of them are unfamiliar with the courses offered by higher
              education institutions. Another issue is that many students are
              unaware that simply meeting the cut-off points for admission to a
              university or college does not imply that they are qualified to
              pursue all of the courses offered by all universities or colleges.
              There is a limit based on your average score and the subjects you
              took for the KCSE exam. I believe that secondary students should
              be informed and trained on how to "go about it" when selecting a
              career path as early as possible.....
